Was lead designer on UH60V translator; my role was to build a translator in MATLAB using MATLAB classes to allow testers to build out scripts in the Army's "Cinnamon Roll" Language and my code would translate the Cinnamon Roll files into MATLAB files. 
I added in the appropriate safeguards for infinite loops and designed the overall flow of the translation. The specifics of the translator tying everything together is not available for viewing, but the individual translation of each individual command from Cinnamon roll 
is available for viewing.
